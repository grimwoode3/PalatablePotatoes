                <p>According to wikipedia, a potato is a starchy, tuberous vegetable that is native to America. However, at Palatable Potatoes, we belive they are much more than just things to eat.</p>

                <p>Potatoes have hundreds of different uses and, although they don't look like much, potatoes can save lives. You may be thinking, how could it do that? Well, let us explain. If someone was having a heart attack and there was no defibrillator, you could cut a potato in half, attach some wires and place the potatoes on this persons chest. Because potatoes can conduct electricity, they will jumpstart the persons heart, thus saving their life.</p>

                <p>
                    <img src="Images/index_potato2.jfif" width="242px" height="242px" alt="Potato" class="leftfloat">
                </p>

                <p>Potatoes can also feed hundreds of people. If you have one potato, you are able to cut it in half and then bury it. By burying it, it will grow into another potato. Continuing this process will allow an infinite amount of potatoes. These potatoes can be given to hungry people and save lives. Potatoes contain starch so they are useful for having a balanced diet. Even a medium sized potato can contain 3-5g of protein.</p>

                <p>Going back to potatoes conducting electricity, they are able to be used as alarm clocks. A common project for children, potato alarm clocks are not only timeless but also extremely fashionable. If your phone is dead or your normal alarm clock isn't working, just make a potato one! Visit <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Potato-Clock">Alarm Recipe</a> on our page to see how to make one.</p>

                <p>So, what is a potato then? Well, a potato is whatever you want it to be, and thats what makes it a potato.
